What is the Horror Project?

It's a mini project that is the base for you to expand upon. It's a little rough around the edges but that shouldn't matter too much, as it's a base for you to build upon and make awesome for whatever use you may need. I advise you rip it apart and see how everything runs.

Well, What Do I Learn In the Project?

Taking apart the project; You'll learn how I got around the Subtitles system; How I used Video to Texture, Basic uses of Matinee for jump-scares .etc - It features ways around casting to things when the thing won't cast (Example, if you can't cast to the level blueprint, cast to the Player and set a bool then call that bool from the Level Blueprint).

It also covers the basics of level streaming for those interested in breaking their huge worlds into smaller chunks.

It's nothing special but it should be something for all to enjoy.

Why did you do this?

Because I love the community and want to help in anyway I can, hence why I write the free books and do what I do!

----------------

Can I use anything I download in my own Project?

Of course! The only problems I should point out is that the Audio is from free sources around the web (When you export them from the file, it should credit the author and origin of the file) and the post-process is from the Epic Games Japan Youtube page, and some of the meshes are from the Realistic Rendering example, but you should be free to follow the rabbit-hole on the origins of those files and I believe you'll be able to use them all commercially too.

---------------

The project isn't finished...?

Because it'd be a perfect exercise to get you to finish it and make it your own!

---------------

Is that... a Twin Peaks Reference?

You mean the dancing man in the red curtained room? I don't think I could've made it more obvious :P

--------------

Can we have some Screenshots / Videos to see what the project is about?

Sure!
